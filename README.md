# Project «Telecom - Identification of inefficient operators»¶
Conducted an analysis of call centers, their number and size depending on the number of working operators. An analysis was also made of the main characteristics of operators, including their number and duration of work in a given time range of the dataset. To evaluate the performance of agents, criteria were defined based on incoming and outgoing calls, such as the number of calls received per agent, the percentage of missed incoming calls, and the response time for incoming external calls. In addition, a detailed analysis of outgoing and incoming calls and their characteristics was carried out, including the distribution of the number of calls per operator per day, the percentage of missed calls and the average duration of a successful outgoing call. The study also tested hypotheses for statistical differences in the data.

### Objective: 
To help "Numpozvoni" to identify signs of inefficient work of operators in order to make a decision on the development and implementation of new functionality to assess the quality of the work of operators.

### Skills and tools:
Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Plotly, SciPy

### Examples of visualizing data from a project:

### Primary signs of poor agent performance:
- many missed incoming calls,
- long waiting for an answer for incoming external calls,
- few outbound pickups - in the case of those call centers that specialize in calling, and not processing incoming calls,
- low number of successful outgoing calls

### Analysis results:
1. The development and implementation of new functionality for assessing the quality of agents can significantly improve the experience and efficiency of call centers.
2. It is recommended to create a service that will be based on configurable thresholds for various evaluation criteria. This approach will allow call centers to adapt the functionality to their needs and preferences.
3. An important aspect of the new functionality should be its accessibility. Providing it for free will maximize its distribution among call centers. This in turn will lead to improved service quality and improved customer satisfaction. In the future, this service may become paid.
4. In general, the creation of such functionality will mean a breakthrough for Nupozvoni in the field of customer service. By allowing customers to measure agent performance and customize evaluation criteria, the company will offer a unique and personalized experience that can improve service levels and enhance customer interactions.
5. In addition, the new functionality can contribute to the development of Nupozvon's client base and attract larger call centers, for which the evaluation of the effectiveness of operators is important.
